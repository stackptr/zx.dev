## Hello, I'm Corey

I'm a software engineer based in 🏡 Portland, OR. I work with Haskell, TypeScript, and [Nix][nix] to build human-centered experiences for the web.

When I’m not coding, you can find me [outside][strava]: cycling, hiking, and rock climbing throughout the Pacific Northwest. I am also fond of playing with synthesizers and hacking on electronics.

I currently work at [Freckle by Renaissance][freckle], helping to empower educators to reach every student at their level. In the past I've worked on [UPchieve][upchieve] and have taught computer science through [TEALS][teals]. I build bikes through the volunteer-run collective [Bike Farm][bikefarm].
