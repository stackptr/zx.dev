## Hello, I'm Corey

I'm a software engineer based in 🏡 Portland, OR. I work with Haskell, TypeScript, and [Nix][nix] to build human-centered experiences for the web.

When I’m not coding, you can find me [riding my bike][strava], backpacking, and rock climbing throughout the Pacific Northwest. I am also fond of playing with synthesizers and hacking on electronics. Other interests of mine include literature, chess, art, coffee, and welding.

I currently work at [Freckle by Renaissance][freckle], helping to empower educators to reach every student at their level through differentiated practice. In the past I've served as Director of Technology with [UPchieve][upchieve] and have taught computer science through [TEALS][teals]. I build bikes through the volunteer-run collective [Bike Farm][bikefarm]. I am passionate about education, infrastructure, and the environment.
